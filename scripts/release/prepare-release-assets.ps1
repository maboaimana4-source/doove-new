# Gather every release-ready binary from the Tauri bundle output into a
# single `release-assets/` directory ready for GitHub Release upload.
#
# Tauri scatters bundle artifacts across multiple paths depending on
# whether a target triple was specified at build time; this script
# walks both candidate roots and collects every file matching the known
# release extensions. Throws if nothing is found — that almost always
# means the build step failed silently or the bundle config drifted.
#
# Inputs:
#   - $PlatformName arg — matrix.platform.name, used only in the error
#                         message ("No release assets found for X").
#   - $RustTarget   arg — Rust target triple.
