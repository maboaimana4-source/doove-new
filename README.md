## About

Doove is an open-source screen recorder and editor that runs entirely on your
machine. No account is required to record, no telemetry phones home, and
nothing is uploaded by default. When you want to share a finished video, push
it to your own Google Drive from the export dialog and copy the link.

A hosted sharing layer (Doove Cloud) with watch analytics and team
workspaces is on the way. It is storage-agnostic by design: bring your own
storage on the free tier, or use Doove-managed storage or a custom S3, R2,
Azure, or GCP bucket on paid plans.

For the full feature catalog, screenshots, and competitor comparisons, see
the [marketing site](https://doove.nexonauts.com). This README focuses on
running the codebase locally.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+, Rust 1.70+, and the
[Tauri OS prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your
platform. The setup script can auto-install any of these that are missing.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kanakkholwal/doove.git
cd doove

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup.ps1

# macOS / Linux
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Run the desktop app in dev mode:

```sh
pnpm --filter doove-desktop dev
```

Run the marketing website:

```sh
pnpm turbo run dev --filter=doove-web
```

Prefer to set things up by hand? See the
[manual setup steps in CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#manual-setup).

manual setup, building production binaries, the changelog and release
workflow, and how to submit pull requests.
