/**
 * The event taxonomy — the single source of truth for every product-analytics
 * event Doove emits, shared by both the web app and the desktop app so the
 * names never drift between surfaces.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - `snake_case`, `object_action`, past tense for completed actions
 *     (`export_completed`, not `complete_export`).
 *   - Properties are flat, `snake_case`, and carry **no PII** — no filenames,
 *     absolute paths, share slugs, emails, or hostnames. IDs only when they're
 *     non-identifying (a visibility enum, a codec name, a duration).
 *   - Add an event by extending `ANALYTICS_EVENTS`; add a typed prop shape in
 *     `EventPropMap` if call sites should be constrained.
 *
 * Global super-properties (`app_version`, `os`, `source`, `user_plan`,
 * `user_type`) are registered once at init by each app's analytics client and
 * merged into every event — do NOT pass them per-call.
