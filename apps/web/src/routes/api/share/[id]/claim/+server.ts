 * viewer submits an email; if it's on the share's allowlist we email a
 * one-click verify link (see ../claim/verify). Mirrors a magic link, but
 * scoped to this share — it never creates a Doove account, which matters
 * because sign-up is waitlist-gated.
 *
 * Response is intentionally generic ("if you're on the list, check your
 * mail") so the endpoint can't be used to enumerate who was invited.
