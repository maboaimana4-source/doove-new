 * Rules:
 *   - Visibility ∈ {public, workspace|team, private}. `selected` is rejected
 *     (use the share dialog to pick people on a new link).
 *   - workspace/team binds the share to a workspace. It defaults to the
 *     doove's own workspace; an explicit `organizationId` is allowed ONLY if
 *     the caller is a member of it (or a global admin) — otherwise a share
 *     owner could expose the doove to a workspace they're not in.
 *   - Manageable by the share owner, an owner/admin of the doove's workspace,
 *     or a global admin (see `resolveShareManage`).
