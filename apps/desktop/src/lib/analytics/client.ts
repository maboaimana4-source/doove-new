/**
 * The desktop app's analytics singleton.
 *
 * Posture (the hard rule): product analytics are strictly opt-in (default OFF);
 * crash reporting is default opt-in (default ON). The provider is NOT stood up
 * at launch for an errors-only install — `eagerInit` is omitted, so PostHog
 * makes zero network calls until a real crash or an explicit opt-in. When
 * `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is blank the whole client is a no-op.
 *
 * The anonymous `distinct_id` is the persistent install id, so a crash reported
 * before sign-in attributes to the same person as later identified events.
