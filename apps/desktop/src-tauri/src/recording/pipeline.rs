/// Spawn the capture + frame-pacer loop.
///
/// Why this is a frame pacer, not a "capture as fast as DXGI delivers" loop:
/// the encoder declares the input rate to FFmpeg as `-framerate {fps}`, so
/// every frame we push contributes 1/fps seconds of *video PTS*, regardless
/// of when it was captured in wall-clock time. DXGI Desktop Duplication
/// only delivers a new frame when the desktop actually changes — for a
/// static screen that's < 1 fps. If we'd push frames at DXGI's natural
/// rate, a 10-second recording with little motion would encode as a 1-2
/// second video, while the cursor track (timestamped from a wall-clock
/// `Instant`) still spans 10 s. The editor would then race through the
/// entire cursor performance in the compressed playback duration —
/// exactly the "everything happens in 5 seconds" symptom.
///
/// To lock playback time to wall-clock time, this loop:
/// 1. Holds a single `last_frame` cache (the most recent captured texture).
/// 2. Polls DXGI non-blocking (`AcquireNextFrame(0)`) every iteration and
///    drains any new frames into the cache, so we always emit the freshest
///    pixels available at the tick instant.
/// 3. Emits exactly `target_fps` frames per real-time second to the
///    pipeline using a deadline scheduler. When DXGI has no new frame, we
///    duplicate the cached one — the video shows a still during static
///    desktop, which is correct.
///
/// Result: wall-clock seconds == video PTS seconds == cursor track
/// seconds. Preview and rendered MP4 stay in lockstep with the cursor
/// track regardless of how often the desktop redraws.
