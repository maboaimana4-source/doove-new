//! Wayland-native screen capture via xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire.
//!
//! See `apps/desktop/docs/linux-native-recording.md` for the full design.
//! In short: we cannot read framebuffers directly on Wayland (compositor
//! security model), so the only legitimate path is to ask the portal for
//! a `ScreenCast` session, accept whatever PipeWire node ID it hands us,
//! and pull frames from that node.
//!
//! The portal handshake happens *before* the recording threads spawn,
//! inside `commands::recording::start_recording` — it has to, because the
//! portal returns the actual stream dimensions, and the encoder is
//! configured from those dimensions when the recording session is built.
//! The handshake stashes the resulting `PortalStream` in this module's
//! static slot; the capture thread (spawned later) picks it up.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   1. Frontend clicks Record on a Wayland session.
//!   2. `start_recording` calls `acquire_portal_stream()` synchronously.
//!      A current-thread tokio runtime spins up, drives the ashpd portal
//!      flow (Create → Select → Start → OpenPipeWireRemote), and tears
//!      down. The user sees the system portal dialog and picks a source.
//!   3. The resulting `PortalStream` (fd + node id + size) is stashed.
//!   4. `recording::RecordingManager::start` builds a `CaptureTarget`
//!      using the portal-supplied dimensions (NOT xcap's) and spawns the
//!      capture thread.
//!   5. `create_capture_source(target)` runs on the capture thread, takes
//!      the stashed stream, and spawns a dedicated PipeWire main-loop
//!      thread that pushes BGRA frames into a crossbeam channel.
//!   6. `WaylandCaptureSource::capture_next` reads frames from that
//!      channel with the trait's timeout semantics.
//!   7. On drop, the stop flag flips, the PipeWire main loop quits, and
//!      the thread joins.

// -- SPA POD format-param construction --------------------------------------

/// Build the EnumFormat POD that we send to pipewire as a stream-connect
/// parameter. This is the most version-sensitive part of the integration:
/// libspa POD layout is a binary protocol and minor pipewire-rs version
/// bumps occasionally rename helpers. The shape below mirrors the
/// upstream `pipewire-rs/examples/screencast.rs` example for 0.9.x.
///
/// We accept BGRA and BGRx as the only formats; the encoder downstream
/// expects packed BGRA at width*4 bytes per row. Compositors almost
/// always produce BGRA on Wayland — if we get an unexpected negotiation
/// the `process` callback's stride check will silently drop frames; we
/// can teach this builder more formats later if real-world devices need
/// it.
