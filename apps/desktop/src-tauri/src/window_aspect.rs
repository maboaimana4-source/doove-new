//! Aspect-ratio-locked window resizing.
//!
//! Tao (Tauri's windowing layer) only exposes min/max size constraints — it
//! has no aspect-ratio lock. The JS side can *snap back* to an aspect after a
//! resize finishes (`onResized` → `setSize`), but that reads as a janky
//! rubber-band: the OS lets you drag width and height independently, then the
//! box jumps once you release. To make the camera-preview bubble resize
//! *proportionally while you drag* — and to cap its width at a fraction of the
//! monitor — we intercept `WM_SIZING` natively on Windows and rewrite the drag
//! rectangle in real time.
//!
//! Non-Windows builds get a no-op `apply` so callers don't need their own
//! `cfg`; the JS snap-to-aspect fallback keeps those platforms usable until a
//! native equivalent (macOS: `NSWindow.aspectRatio`) lands.
